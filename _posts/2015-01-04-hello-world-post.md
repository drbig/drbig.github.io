This is not a blog in the meaning of 'periodic, short to medium length posts on a specific topic'. It's more of a place to put in writing thoughts, findings, annoyances and general random stuff. In other words - a trash bin.

Having said that, I have a collection of loose topics that will probably make their way here:

 - Open source projects and collaboration
 - Operating systems, especially the Unix family
 - Easy embedded electronics, from MCUs to Raspberry Pi
 - Retro gaming, aka emulators galore
 - Musings on current and future states of the financial industries
 - Occasional ranting on whatever annoys me to the point of writing about it

There is no schedule; minimal (or maximum) post lengths. This is a completely non-commercial endeavour, at best it might help 'promote myself', whatever that is supposed to mean. The only thing that _must_ be is quality, which boils down to honesty, factual accuracy and gracious application of a spell-checker. I don't think anyone wishes to become an editor for me.

An average of a post a month would be a new record though.
