Hi!

I'm Piotr Staszewski, though on the internets I go by the nick dRbiG, for reasons long lost in the primordial soup of 14.4k dial-ups. Feel free to check the following:

 - My [GitHub](https://github.com/drbig) account
 - My [old blog](http://logs.drbig.one.pl/), still served from my ADSL box

Some projects I've contributed to:

 - [Cataclysm: DDA](http://en.cataclysmdda.com/) - post-apocalyptic rouge-like
 - [Camlistore](https://camlistore.org/) - 'your personal storage system for life'
 - [i3-wm](https://i3wm.org/) - a very decent tiling window manager

You can contact me, in order of preference:

 - On IRC at [FreeNode](irc://chat.freenode.net/dRbiG,isnick) or [IRCNet](irc://polska.irc.pl/dRbiG,isnick)
 - By E-Mail at [p.staszewski@gmail.com](mailto:p.staszewski@gmail.com)
 - On [Twitter](https://twitter.com/pstaszewski), if you insist

I've ditched Facebook (and the general idea as expressed by such sites) completely a year ago. As far as social and web I'm there on [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/d2biG). And if anything I'd rather see everyone had their own [federated wiki](http://fed.wiki.org/view/how-to-wiki).
